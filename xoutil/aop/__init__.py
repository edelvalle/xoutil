'''
Very simple AOP implementation allowing method replacing in objects with change
function, reset an object to its original state and user a special super
function inner new functions used to inject the new behavior.

Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) increase modularity by allowing the separation
of cross-cutting concerns.

An aspect can alter the behavior of the base code (the non-aspect part of a
program) by applying advice (additional behavior) at various join-points (points
in a program) specified in a quantification or query called a point-cut (that
detects whether a given join point matches).

An aspect can also make structural changes to other classes, like adding members
or parents.
