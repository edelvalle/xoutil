'''
Tree structures can be traversed in many different ways. Starting at
the root of a binary tree, there are three main steps that can be
performed and the order in which they are performed defines the
traversal type. These steps (in no particular order) are:

- performing an action on the current node (referred to as "visiting"
  the node),
- traversing to the left child node, and 
- traversing to the right child node.

The names given for particular style of traversal came from the
position of root element with regard to the left and right nodes:

* Depth-first Traversal: Imagine that the left and right nodes are
  constant in space, then

     - pre-order, the root node could be placed to the left of the
       left node
     - in-order, between the left and right node
     - post-order, to the right of the right node

* Breadth-first traversal: where we visit every node on a level before
  going to a lower level:

     - level-order

This module is intended to contain all requirements for "Tree
Traversal".
