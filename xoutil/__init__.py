.. currentmodule:: xoutil

`xoutil` is a collection of disparate utilities that does not conform
a framework for anything. `xoutil` is essentially an extension to the
Python's standard library.

But also, xoutil provides implementations of simple tools for several
programming tasks. For instance the :py:mod:`xoutil.aop` provides two
very basic implementations of what may be called Aspect-Oriented
Programming (AOP), but we do not claim any affiliation to other AOP
frameworks. In fact, we believe that Python's dynamic nature makes so
easy the injection of code that every team would probably use it's own
AOP mini-framework.

.. note:: This list is still incomplete.
