'''
Works similar to Paul Sundvall's 'rdfind' but programmed in Python.

Finds duplicate files in directories, and takes appropriate actions.

Use an storage system based on 'HashingIndexex'. 'DictHashingIndexer' is
provided with a basic implementation based in a Python 'dict'.

A rank is assigned to each file in order to figure out which file is the
best candidate for being the original meaning that if a file is found on
several places, the one found with the higher rank is the proposed to be
kept (the others are considered duplicates).

It can be used as a Python module or as an command line application.

Usage when used as an application:

    dupfind [options] dir-1 dir-2 ...


Options are:

    --make-symlinks
            Replace duplicate files with symbolic links.

    --make-hardlinks
            Replace duplicate files with hard links.

    -d, --delete
            Delete duplicate files.

    --backup=DIR
            With this option, duplicated files are moved to a backup directory.
            You control where the backup file goes through the parameter DIR.
            If it is not specified the standard temporal directory is used.

    --safe
            Execute dangerous duplicate file processing -like delete- after
            detection process has completed, not during.

    --list-only
            Replace the standard output with duplicate files name in order to
            concatenate this command with the execution of 'xargs' in a pipe.
            No internal action is executed, so this option is incompatible
            with delete and backup actions.

    --results=FILE
            Create a file with a report similar to command 'rdfind', if the
            parameter FILE is not specified 'result.txt' is generated.

    --filter=PATTERN
            Exclude files matching simple shell-style wild-cards a la
            'fnmatch'.
            In filters, the character '/' will be converted to the character
            used by the operating system to separate pathname components. This
            is the proper '/' for POSIX and '\\' for Windows.
            Filtered files are all treated always as not duplicated.

            Patterns are Unix shell style:
                *         matches everything
                ?         matches any single character
                [seq]     matches any character in seq
                [!seq]    matches any char not in seq

    --filter-regex=PATTERN
            Exclude files matching a regular expression. Remember that to
            include a '\' character you must double it (\\).
            Filtered files are all treated always as not duplicated.

    --filter-size=SIZE
            Exclude files which size is less than that SIZE. If this option is
            not specified SIZE is assumed as "1". Use "0" to include all files.
            Filtered files are all treated always as not duplicated.

    --find=FILE
            Search for a file in specified workspace using content comparing.

            Create the hash index for locating matching files inside the
            workspace defined for all folders specified as arguments.

            This option implies "--list-only", if you want to change this
            behavior increment verbose level (-v) or use "--results".

    -c, --checksum
            This changes the way 'dupfind' checks if the files are duplicated
            or not. By default 'dupfind' uses a "quick method" that checks
            each fileâ€™s size, then first and last four bytes of each content.
            If the "quick method" is not good enough, without this option,
            'dupfind' will compare at most 128 bytes from the middle of each
            file content, and with this option compare a 256-bit MD5 checksum
            for each file that has matching size and first and last four bytes.

    --sleep=X
            Sleep for X milliseconds between each file reads processing.

    -l, --follow-symlinks
            Follow symbolic links. Those which point inside any specified tree,
            always are ignored.

    --out-format=FORMAT
            Output each file processing using the specified FORMAT
            Note that the names of the processed files that are output are
            done using a default of "{name}{link}", which tells you just the
            name of the file and, if the item is a link, where it points in
            the format '-> original-path'.

            Format specifiers could be:
                {name}    full file name
                {link}    where a symbolic link points to, or blank string if
                          the item is not a symbolic link.

    -v, --verbose
            This option increases the amount of information you are given
            during the file processing. By default, 'dupfind' works almost
            silently (statistic information).
            A single '-v' will give you information about what files are being
            processed and a brief summary at the end.
            Two '-v' options will give you also information on what files are
            being skipped and slightly more information at the end.
            More than two '-v' options should only be used if you are
            debugging 'dupfind'.

    --version
            Show program's version and exit

    -h, --help
            Show the help for the command.
